Here's what I know about the Final Exam:

- You have 2 weeks from the release of Lesson 12 to complete the course, including the Final Exam.  For this section, Lesson 12 was released on September 23, so that means you should plan to complete the Final Exam by October 07.
- I do not know what Time Zone the server is located on, therefore you should plan to complete the Final as soon as possible to avoid potential issues.
- The Exam is 36 multiple-choice questions.  These questions are similar to the Quiz questions.
- Technically, there is no time limit, but I am told that no activity in the classroom for something like 2 hours will time you out and you'll have to log back in, so your answers will most likely be lost, which would mean that you would need to start over.  It shouldn't take you 2 hours though.
- You may only submit your answers for grading one time.
- Once you pass the Final Exam, you will have the ability to print your Completion Certificate.  I do not know where this is located in the course or how you are to print it (I do not see what you see as a student)
Please know that I have no control over the administration of this course - I'm just here to answer questions about the course content.  If you have administrative type questions (extension requests, problems with getting your Certificate, etc), you should use the Support link at the bottom of the page.  That will help to put you in contact with the folks who administer the course (but who know nothing about the course materials).

Best of luck!
